Cmd.vim is a vim plugin to provide vim the ability to execute shell command
directly in vim and echo the result in vim. For example, you could use ":!ls"
to list all the files of current directory, Now cmd.vim provide a new command
":Ls" to implement the same function, but the result is in vim insteading of in
the shell. The mainpage in Chinese is avaiable at:

There are many well known shell command to implement powerful functions, now I
port them to vim version, In the current release, there are four command
available now, More are to be added. For those not listed below, you could use
":Shell your_command" to execute your_command like "! your_command", with the
result in Vim insteading of Shell.

	":Date" - print or set the system date and time
	":Gcc" - gcc - GNU project C and C++ compiler
	":Ls" - list directory contents
	":Sdcv Words" - call sdcv to lookup Words in vim

[Note]: Please note that since Vim claim user defined commands must start with an
uppercase letter, so every shell command start with an uppercase letter.

[Note]: Please note that cmd.vim is an adapter, So please make sure the original
command is available. it is expected that cmd.vim works where the original
command works, whatever it's Linux, Cygwin, Windows, or Mac. 

[Note]: In most circumstances, it will be better if you map them to your
favorite map, For example, To look up the a word under the cursor, or to lookup
the words selected:

	nmap <script> <silent> <unique> <Leader>l <ESC>:Sdcv '<cword>' <CR>
	vmap <script> <silent> <unique> <Leader>l y<ESC>:Sdcv <c-r>" <CR>
